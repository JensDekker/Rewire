Development Plan for Rewire App
===============================

1. RoomDB Setup in App Module
-----------------------------
- Move all RoomDB-related code (entities, DAOs, database class) to the Android app module.
- Remove Room dependencies from non-Android modules.
- Create Room entities for Habit, AddictionHabit, AbstinenceGoal, Note, etc.
- Define DAOs for each entity with CRUD operations.
- Create the Room database class and include all DAOs.

2. Write Instrumented Tests for RoomDB
--------------------------------------
- Use the `androidTest` directory to write tests for DAOs and database logic.
- Use an in-memory Room database for fast, isolated tests.
- Test all CRUD operations, relationships, and edge cases.
- Ensure migrations (if any) work as expected.

3. Implement Repository/Manager Layer
-------------------------------------
- Create repository or manager classes to abstract RoomDB access.
- Expose suspend functions or LiveData/Flow for use in ViewModels and UI.
- Keep business logic and data access separate from UI code.

4. Design and Build the UI (Frontend)
-------------------------------------
- Design screens for:
  - Habit list, detail, add/edit
  - Addiction list, detail, add/edit
  - Notes management
  - Usage plan management
- Use ViewModel and LiveData/Flow to connect UI to repository layer.
- Implement navigation and user flows.

5. Integrate UI with RoomDB
---------------------------
- Connect UI screens to the repository/manager layer.
- Ensure all user actions (add, edit, delete, complete, log usage, notes) update the database and UI correctly.
- Handle loading, error, and empty states in the UI.

6. Test the Full App
--------------------
- Manually test all features using the UI.
- Add more instrumented/UI tests for critical flows and edge cases.
- Fix bugs and polish user experience.

7. Polish and Document
----------------------
- Refine UI/UX, handle edge cases, and improve error handling.
- Update documentation and README to reflect the final architecture and usage.
- Prepare the app for release (icons, splash screen, Play Store requirements, etc.).

---

**Summary:**
- Set up and test RoomDB in the app module.
- Build a repository layer for clean architecture.
- Develop the UI and connect it to your data layer.
- Test, polish, and document the app for release.
